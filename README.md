# Development
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

The development of the Train Ticket Reservation System involved several key stages, each leveraging a suite of robust tools and technologies to ensure efficiency, scalability, and user-friendliness.

Planning and Analysis
The initial phase focused on understanding the requirements and objectives of the system. This involved discussions with stakeholders to gather requirements, followed by a detailed analysis to outline the system's functionality, user workflows, and technical specifications.

Design
In the design phase, the architectural blueprint of the system was created. This included designing the database schema, user interface layouts, and defining the interactions between various components. Tools such as NetBeans IDE 22 were instrumental in this phase, providing a platform to draft and visualize the design.

Implementation
The implementation phase saw the actual coding and development of the system.

NetBeans IDE 22: Used for coding and development. The environment provided essential features for writing and debugging Java code.

MariaDB: Employed for database management. The server handled data storage, retrieval, and manipulation, ensuring secure and efficient database operations.

Apache & PHP: Used to handle server-side scripting, facilitating smooth communication between the server and client-side components.

phpMyAdmin: Aided in database management tasks, such as running queries and managing database tables.

XAMPP: Set up a local server environment, simplifying development and testing processes.

Jaspersoft Studio: Utilized for creating and designing comprehensive reports, enhancing the system's reporting capabilities.

Testing
In this phase, various types of testing were conducted to ensure the system's functionality, performance, and security. Unit tests, integration tests, and system tests were performed to identify and fix bugs, ensuring that the system operated smoothly under different conditions.

Deployment
Once testing was complete and the system was stable, it was deployed to a production environment. This involved setting up the system on a live server, configuring the database, and ensuring all components were correctly integrated.

Maintenance and Updates
Post-deployment, the system requires ongoing maintenance to address any issues that arise and to implement updates and enhancements. This ensures the system remains functional, secure, and efficient over time.

Key Tools and Technologies:
NetBeans IDE 22: For application design and development.

MariaDB: For robust database management.

Apache & PHP: For server-side operations.

phpMyAdmin: For managing the MariaDB database.

XAMPP: For setting up a local server environment.

Jaspersoft Studio: For designing and generating detailed reports.

By following this structured development process, we ensured the Train Ticket Reservation System was built efficiently, met user needs, and provided a reliable, scalable solution for managing train reservations.
